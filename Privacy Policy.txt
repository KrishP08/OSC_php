**2. Purpose of Collection**
Collected data enables:
* User authentication and account management
* Submission tracking, grading, and notifications

**3. Data Sharing**
Your policy should clarify that data is not shared with third partiesâ€”unless legally required, or unless users consent, or in case of an official investigation.

**4. Data Storage and Security**
Detail how data is stored (e.g. in MySQL locally). Encourage use of secure practices: HTTPS, hashed passwords, backups, and server security.

**5. Cookies and Tracking**
If applicable, mention the use of cookies or session data.

**6. User Rights**
Users can request data correction or account deletion (if such functionality exists or will exist).
